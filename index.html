    <p class="brg"> Error handling and debugging Types of Errors
        Programming errors are generally broken down into three types: 1-Design-time
        2- Runtime
        3-Logic errors.</p>
        <p>
        
        Continue error </p>
        <p> A Design-time error is also known as a syntax error. These
            occur when the environment you're programming in doesn't
            understand your code. These are easy to track down in VB.NET,
            because you get a blue wiggly line pointing them out.<br>
             If you try
            to run the program, you'll get a dialogue box popping up telling
            you that there were Build errors.</p>
